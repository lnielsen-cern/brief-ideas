===========

What is this? It's a teeny tiny journal, composed entirely of 'brief ideas'. The goal here is to provide a place for short ideas to be described (in 200 words or less), for these ideas to be archived (courtesy of [Zenodo](http://zenodo.org)), searchable and citable.

It's a work in progress by [@arfon](http://twitter.com/arfon), [@larshankat](http://twitter.com/larshankat), [@physicsdavid](http://twitter.com/physicsdavid) and [@stuart_lynn](http://twitter.com/stuart_lynn)

You can see the latest build of this running at http://ideas.theoj.org

## Oh I get it, you think you're changing the world

Not really, we just think that sometimes you want to share an idea with the world, would like to receive credit for this idea but don't have a paper's worth of material. Why waffle on when it can be said in 200 words?

## Development status

This is very much a work in progress. We've got a [milestone tracking](https://github.com/openjournals/brief-ideas/milestones) the beta release.

### Is it green?

Hopefully/probably? You can keep an eye on Travis stuff here:
